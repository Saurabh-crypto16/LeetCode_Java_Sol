In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the 
border of the array(i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?
=> When matrix is sparce and number of live cells are very less than dead so here we process only one row at a time by storing it in a file
